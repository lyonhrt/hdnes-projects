These are HD graphics packs for the nes emulator hdnes by mkwong https://github.com/mkwong98/HDNes

Although I will try my best to support all rom versions, please use the reccomended rom. 

To use just name the folder the same as the rom name

Update, although still a litte bit buggy, you can also use these packs on mesen https://github.com/SourMesen/Mesen
just put them in hdpack directory
